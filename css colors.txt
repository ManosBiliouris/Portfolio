Core Color Palette
Background (Dark Mode):

Deep Charcoal/Black (#121212 or #0D0D0D): This will be the consistent, dark background across the site, providing the foundation for all the design elements. It's easy on the eyes and enhances the glowing, bioluminescent effects.
Mountain Section (Digital, Geometric Vibe):

Cool Blue (#0077FF or #1C8FE8): For the mountain lines and geometric shapes, this cool, icy blue will give that techy, digital feel. It’s vibrant enough to pop against the dark background without being overwhelming.
Lighter Blue Accent (#66CCFF): Use this for hover effects or any active states to make certain mountain lines or interactive elements glow or highlight when interacted with.
Transition/Blend Between Mountain and Sea:

Gradient from Blue to Purple: The transition between the mountain and sea can be visually marked with a gradient that smoothly blends the cool blue into the vibrant purple. This keeps the flow of the site seamless.
Gradient example: #1C8FE8 (blue) → #8A2BE2 (purple). Use this as a subtle background gradient between sections or to mark transitions in the content (e.g., on scroll).
Sea Section (Bioluminescent, Flowing Vibe):

Vibrant Purple (#8A2BE2 or #4B0082): For the sea section, use this deep, glowing purple to create the bioluminescent effect. It contrasts beautifully with the dark background and transitions nicely from the blue mountain above.
Soft Glow Effect (#B366FF): This lighter purple will be used for the bioluminescent dots and highlights, adding a glowing, mystical effect. The glow will be subtle, not overpowering, but enough to create that otherworldly feel.
Typography Colors:

Text (Body): Use Light Gray (#E0E0E0) for all regular text to keep it readable without clashing with the design. It’s softer than pure white, so it doesn’t feel harsh against the dark mode background.
Headlines/Key Words: For emphasis, you could use a glowing blue (#66CCFF) or soft purple (#B366FF) in headings or important phrases. This will match the color of the section it's in, e.g., blue in the mountain section, purple in the sea section.
Subtle Neon Glow for Titles: You can add a slight neon glow (very minimal) to make key headings or call-to-actions stand out.
